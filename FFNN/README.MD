The workflow of a feedforward neural network is as follows:

Input data is passed to the input layer.

Forward propagation computes the output using weights, biases, and activation functions.

Loss is calculated to measure prediction error.

Backpropagation adjusts weights and biases using gradients.

This process is repeated for several epochs until the model converges to a minimum loss.

The trained model is evaluated and used for predictions.
